## Your Web Application Title

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

## CSS Requirements

I used a grid to display all of the inputs in the task-form. The grid is made up of two columns and two rows, the description input stretching across two columnts using grid-column: 1 / 3. There are also many examples of flexbox, one of them being the form itself. The content-container is a flex container, the flexbox orders its child elements vertically, and centered.

Id selectors were used for the task-form and the inputs inside the form, class selectors were used for the buttons beside the tasks as well as for the many containers (button, input, and main container).

Used the Source Code Pro font from Google Fonts. CSS defined in a maintainable, readable form, in a external stylesheet (main.css).
